# Neuron UI

Neuron UI is the front-end desktop application for users to create block diagrams of neural networks.

Neuron UI is an IDE of sorts for users to manipulate the diagrams and code of neural networks in order to test new architectures and concepts for machine learning, big data interpretation, and complex function approximation. Used in conjunction with Neuron's back-end neural network compiler and tester, the entire process of creating a neural network and its code can be automated from front to back.

## About
Neuron uses the same components as [GitHub's Atom Text Editor](https://atom.io/). Built on [Electron](https://http://electron.atom.io) and Node.js, Neuron UI is a cross-platform development environment that integrates tightly with a suite of proven technologies to create a neural network development pipeline.

## Installation
Neuron UI can be compiled from source, or downloaded as a package (Coming Soon).
Make sure to check out the suite of tools used by Neuron on the back-end.

### To install Neuron UI from the ground up:
Make sure you have Node.js, npm, and git installed first.

```
# Download the Neuron UI source from GitHub.
$ git clone https://github.com/ajthor/neuron-ui
$ cd neuron-ui

# Install dependencies.
$ npm install

# Run.
$ npm start
```
And that's it!

## Contributing
I always welcome contributors to the project, and ask that you take a look at the contribution guidelines outlined in the project source.
